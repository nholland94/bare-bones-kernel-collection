# Bare Bones Kernel Collection
(repo under construction)

This repository is a collection of bare bones kernels in various languages. This repository mainly exists for my own experimentation and research, but can also serve as examples of how to compile various languages so that you can use the language for writing a kernel. None of these implementations are written purely in the language of choice, but as much code as is possible is written in that language. Some languages just need an assembly file to bootstrap the environment, and others need a decent amount of assembly or C code in order to provide functionality required by the environment.

## List of Languages

- Current
  - Ada (mostly complete)
  - C (need to move)
  - ATS (not completed yet)
