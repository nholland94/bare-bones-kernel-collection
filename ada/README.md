# Ada Bare Bones Kernel

This bare bones kernel is based off of the Ada bare bones tutorial from the [osdev wiki](http://wiki.osdev.org/Ada_Bare_bones). It has been modified in a few ways, and will have some extra features by the time that I finish working on this (I want to get syscalls + processes in, maybe libc for some extra meat).
